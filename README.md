# citystocker

## Project Introduction

This is my final year project in City University of Hong Kong. I came up with this project because I have seen so many people loosing their money in cryptocurrency market in 2021~2022. 

I wanted people to try practicing the coin trade without loosing any real money. Also run a backtesting of customizable trade algorithm to check the performance of algorithm based on the real coin market price.

The customizable algorithm is where you can write the code in code editor provided in the website using the class provided by the website. Without any other settings, you can simply run algorithm trading of your own.
